## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jamad/jamad.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain your website in Markdown files.
When committed, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages from the Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jamad/jamad.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
